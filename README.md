# Deep Learning Technique and Diffusion Model for Generative AI

This project explores the integration of deep learning techniques and diffusion models to build a powerful generative AI system. It focuses on using state-of-the-art generative models to synthesize high-quality images (or other media) by learning the data distribution through a diffusion process.

## 🧠 Overview

Generative AI has seen rapid advancement through the development of diffusion models, which iteratively denoise data to generate realistic samples. This project implements and experiments with:

- Deep neural network architectures (e.g., U-Net, Transformer-based backbones)
- Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)
- Training pipelines on image datasets
- Image generation, sampling techniques, and evaluation metrics

## 🔧 Features

- Customizable U-Net backbone for diffusion-based generation
- Training and inference code using PyTorch
- Support for conditional generation (optional)
- Logging and visualization of samples during training
- Support for multiple datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, CelebA, custom data)
